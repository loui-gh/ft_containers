# ft_containers
Task: Implement the vector and map containers using the structure of the respective STL containers as reference. As with all C++ 42 projects, only the C++98 standard may be used.

Vector::
A vector is a dynamic array.

Tip from Andrei (mat10243x) : work out what functions need to be included. To see what the header you have to build actually looks like, 
$ cd /usr/include/c++/11/bits
$ code .
^^this brings ups all the standard c++ headers
The functions included in C++98 can be deduced from cplusplus.com and cppreference.com
Tip from Ulli: just start with the constructor and destructor


NEXT UP: What is a container? A vector? Build your containers constructors. Don't be afraid to use your favourited ref to check how it's supposed to look :)
